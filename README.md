# odin-recipes

3-20-2025

This is a project assignment through The Odin Project. I will be making a main index page that will have links to a few recipes. It will not look pretty since I have not learned CSS yet, but it will be updated over time once I learn.

This project is going to help me refine my HTML skills before I include CSS in.
