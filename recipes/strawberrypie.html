        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This fluffy strawberry pie is a no-bake recipe my grandmother would make every year for Thanksgiving. 
            She would make it with a homemade pie crust, but I also love it with a graham cracker crust. 
            Either way is great! It's perfect for a very sweet and light dessert. 
            It just melts in your mouth! Enjoy!</p>
